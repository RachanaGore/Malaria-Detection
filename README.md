# Malaria Detection using Deep Learning
- This is a classification problem, where two Deep Learning models are used and their performances are compared. 
 - Model 1: Convolutional Neural Network
 - Model 2: VGG-19 (Image augmentation is applied in this section).
- There are two improvements seen from Model 1 to Model 2: Overfitting reduced and Accuracy increased
# Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- cv2
- matplotlib
